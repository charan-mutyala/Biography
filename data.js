      Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and briefly attended the
      University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 18, acquiring
      citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he
      matriculated at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, and two years
      after that transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he
      received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to
      California in 1995 to attend Stanford University. After two days, he
      dropped out and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded the online city guide
      software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million
      in 1999, and with $12 million of the money he made, that same year Musk
      co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to
      form PayPal.

      Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School,
      and Pretoria Boys High School, from where he graduated.Musk applied for a
      Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother, knowing that it would
      be easier to immigrate to the United States this way.While waiting for his
      application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for
      five months. Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989 and lived with a second
      cousin in Saskatchewan for a year,working odd jobs at a farm and lumber

      In early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and
      discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars. In
      October of the same year, he traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell and Adeo
      Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that
      could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with the companies
      NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice and the
      group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the
      group returned to Russia with Mike Griffin to look for three ICBMs. They
      had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8
      million, which Musk rejected. He instead decided to start a company that
      could build affordable rockets.With $100 million of his own money, Musk
      founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and Chief Engineer

      SpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006.Though
      the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial
      Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA Administrator
      (and former SpaceX consultant) Mike Griffin later that year. After two
      more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk and his companies to go
      bankrupt,SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in
      2008.Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply
      Services contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and
      Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station, replacing the Space
      Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.In 2012, the Dragon vehicle docked with
      the ISS, a first for a commercial spacecraft

      <u>Starlink</u>

    <p>
      In 2015, SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of
      low-Earth-orbit satellites to provide satellite Internet access, with the
      first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of
      test satellites, and the first large deployment of a piece of the
      constellation, occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational
      satellites were launched.The total cost of the decade-long project to
      design, build, and deploy the constellation is estimated by SpaceX to be
      about $10 billion.Some critics, including the International Astronomical
      Union, have alleged that Starlink blocks the view of the sky and poses a
      collision threat to spacecraft
    </p>
    <p>
      During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Musk sent Starlink terminals to
      Ukraine to provide Internet access and communication.However, Musk refused
      to block Russian state media on Starlink, declaring himself "a free speech
      absolutist". In October 2022, Musk stated that about 20,000 satellite
      terminals had been donated to Ukraine, together with free data transfer
      subscriptions, which cost SpaceX $80 million. After asking the United
      States Department of Defense to pay for further units and future
      subscriptions on behalf of Ukraine, Musk publicly stated that SpaceX would
      continue to provide Starlink to Ukraine for free, at a yearly cost to
      itself of $400 million

      Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in July 2003 by
      Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the
      Series A round of funding. Both men played active roles in the company's
      early development prior to Musk's involvement.Musk led the Series A round
      of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became the
      majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as
      chairman.Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster
      product design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business
      operations
    </p>
    <p>
      Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, and the financial
      crisis of 2007–2008, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.Musk assumed
      leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.A 2009
      lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder,
      along with Tarpenning and two others. As of 2019, Musk was the
      longest-tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally. In 2021, Musk
      nominally changed his title to "Technoking" while retaining his position
      as CEO

    <p style={{ display: "inline" }}>
      Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity,
      which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive founded in 2006.By 2013, SolarCity
      was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United
      States. In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced
      production facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest
      solar plant in the United States.Construction of the factory started in
      2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with
      Panasonic until early 2020.<br></br>
      <br></br>
      Tesla acquired SolarCity for over $2 billion in 2016 and merged it with
      its battery unit to create Tesla Energy. The deal's announcement resulted
      in a more than 10% drop in Tesla's stock price. At the time, SolarCity was
      facing liquidity issues.Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit
      against Musk and Tesla's directors, claiming that the purchase of
      SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla
      and its shareholders.Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January 2020,
      leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant.Two years later, the court ruled
      in Musk's favor
